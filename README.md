# wartool
Warcraft III mod with a set of tools that I deemed necessary. **This project is now discontinued and abandoned.**

This mod was developed just for fun and contains not very good code.

Only 1.26a version is supported, but other versions should be working just fine (well, not really, widescreen and custom FOV fixes are working only on 1.26a).

## Features
- Locking cursor in a window
- Discord RPC
- PNG screenshots (INCOMPLETE)
- Widescreen fix
- Custom FOV fix

## Installation
Installation process should be very easy, just grab the wartool.mix file and move it to the Warcraft III folder.

The file itself can be found in [Actions](https://github.com/keyboardcrash32/wartool/actions).

## Building
Building process should be really straightforward:
1. Install the Visual Studio 2022.
2. Launch it, choose a "Clone a repository" option and insert this link: `https://github.com/keyboardcrash32/wartool.git`.
3. Once the project is cloned and loaded, choose the build type (Debug enables the console logging), press Ctrl+B and wait until it's over.
4. You're done! The file should be in the src/Release folder (or src/Debug if you selected the Debug type).
